Folders
=============

This node.js package implements the folders.io synthetic file system.

Folders may be based on a local file system, a remote file system, or another synthetic file system as provided by a module.
Additional providers are available and can be installed via "npm install folders-modulename".

For example: "npm install folders-ftp" will install an FTP module.
